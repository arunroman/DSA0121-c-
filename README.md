Project:
Title:  Sales Management using C++ and webpages.
Introduction:
This project uses C++ to demonstrate how an online sales management system works. How to use this code: Get the result by following the steps.
 Step 1: Transfer the cpp, jpeg, CSS, and html codes into a single directory. 
Step 2: Run the main.exe application file after the file has been saved. 
Step 3: Understand the operations, functions, and structure by following the output instructions. how it operates
By choosing this option, you will be redirected to the web page scenario from the compiler environment.
Both the compiler and the web pages will display the overall operation or the preferences that you have set.
 

Problem statement:
You are tasked with creating a Sales Management System for a retail business. The system should be capable of managing many areas of sales operations, such as inventory, order processing, customer management, and reporting. Furthermore, to create a user-friendly interface and increase accessibility, the system should integrate with webpages for certain operations.

Reporting:

Generate reports on sales performance, including indicators such as total revenue, best-selling products, etc. Provide information on inventory levels, low stock warnings, and reorder suggestions.


Conclusion:
The Sales Management System project combines C++ backend code with webpages for user interaction. Its functions include inventory management, order processing, and reporting, with the goal of streamlining sales processes. A user-friendly interface, system performance, security measures, and scalability are all important factors to consider. Meeting these requirements improves efficiency and contributes to the success of the retail business.
